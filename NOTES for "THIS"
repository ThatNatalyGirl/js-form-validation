NOTES for "THIS"

With ES6 we have more control of 'this'

With an Event
	- it's the event

With a regular function this is defined by what called it

=> arrow functions
	-it ignores who called it and inherits it for it's parent


call - call is all about changing 'this'. Call it right NOW and put x as 'this' - call vs reference	
bind - when you call that function LATER you're going to put this x as 'this' - reference vs call
define


let $thumbnails = document.querySelectoryAll('.thumbnail')

$thumbnails.forEach(function($thumbnails){
	$thumbnail.addEventListener('click', () =>{
		event.target.style.width = '300px';
		event.target.classList.add('active')
	})
})
